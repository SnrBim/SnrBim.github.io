    "content": "When the command is launched, a dialog box opens where you need to specify the source data for synchronization. | Architectural Link: . | The dropdown list shows all linked Revit files where rooms have been found. | The list is automatically sorted: priority is given to links with “AR” in their name, and then by the descending number of rooms. As a rule, the required link is already selected by default. | . | Levels for Synchronization: . | After selecting a link, the list below displays only those levels from that link where rooms containing fire alarm devices have been found. | For each level, the UI now displays a separate count for rooms with devices and empty rooms in the format Rooms: 7 + 10. It also indicates the total number of devices in rooms and homeless devices (not assigned to any room). | You can select one or more levels for processing by checking the boxes next to them. | . | . 3.1. Layout and Mapping Configuration . At the bottom of the window, there are two fields for fine-tuning the command’s behavior: . | Sensor Definitions (Sensors): . | This field determines which devices will be placed in the top row of the diagram (considered “sensors”). All other devices will be placed in the bottom row. | Each line corresponds to one rule. | Format: FamilyName: TypeName. The type name can be omitted, in which case all types of the specified family will be considered sensors. Matching is case-insensitive. | . | Family Mapping: . | This field defines the rules by which 3D device families and types are transformed into 2D symbols on the diagram. | Format: 3D_Family: 3D_Type: 2D_Family: 2D_Type. | Each line represents a single rule. For example, the line SRS_Smoke_Detector: Standard: Fire alarm 2d: Smoke detector means that all 3D devices with family SRS_Smoke_Detector and type Standard will be represented on the diagram by the 2D symbol Smoke detector from the family Fire alarm 2d. Matching of 3D family and type names is case-insensitive. | Automatic Pre-population: When the dialog opens, the command automatically scans the Revit model and identifies all unique (3D_Family, 3D_Type) combinations of fire alarm devices. | Any newly discovered (3D_Family, 3D_Type) combinations that are not yet in the user’s saved mapping settings are automatically appended to the list. For these new entries, the default values Fire alarm 2d and Generic are used for the 2D family and 2D type, respectively. | Existing user settings, including comments and order, are always preserved. | . | Editing Features: The field includes a built-in header demonstrating the string format and uses a monospaced font for convenience. | Comments: Lines starting with a ; character are ignored during parsing but are preserved and can be used for comments. | Alignment: Text in this field is automatically aligned for better readability. | . | . 3.2. Additional Options . | Create empty rooms: . | If this option is enabled (checked), the command will create 2D representations for all rooms on the selected levels, even if they do not contain any fire alarm devices. | By default, this option is disabled, and 2D rooms are only created for 3D rooms that contain at least one device. | . | . 3.3. Manual Placement and Room Locking . After the initial diagram creation, you may want to manually adjust the layout of devices within certain rooms and lock their positions to prevent them from being reset during subsequent synchronizations. This is achieved using the “Manual placement” instance parameter (a Yes/No type) on the 2D room family. | How it works: . | Select one or more 2D rooms on the diagram. | In the Properties palette, find the “Manual placement” parameter and check the box (set its value to “Yes”). | . | What happens on the next sync: . | Device Positions are Preserved: The command will no longer automatically arrange the existing 2D devices within this room. Their current positions will be locked. | Room Width is Preserved: The width of this 2D room will also be locked and will not automatically change based on the number of devices. | New Devices: If new devices are added to this room in the 3D model, their 2D symbols will appear in the center of the locked room. This allows you to easily find and manually place them where needed. | . | . ",
