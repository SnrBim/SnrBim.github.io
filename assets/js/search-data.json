This provides maximum flexibility. | . Managing the Mapping File: . | “Path to Excel file” field: Enter the path to your .xlsx file here. The path is saved between Revit sessions. | “Browse…” button: Opens a dialog to select the file. | “Export Default Settings” button: Creates a template Excel file with the standard rules. You can use this as a starting point for your own mappings. | “Reload” button: Allows you to manually refresh the summary information after making changes to the Excel file. | . 2. Filters and Options . | “Ignore ‘Generic Models’ category”: Enabled by default. This excludes elements of this category from processing, as they are often auxiliary. | “Debug mode”: If this checkbox is selected, the command will execute all logic, analyze the elements, and generate a detailed report, but will not make any changes to the model.

    "title": "3. Step 1: Selecting Source Data",
    "content": "When the command is launched, a dialog box opens where you need to specify the source data for synchronization. | Architectural Link: . | The dropdown list shows all linked Revit files where rooms have been found. | The list is automatically sorted: priority is given to links with “AR” in their name, and then by the descending number of rooms. As a rule, the required link is already selected by default. | . | Levels for Synchronization: . | After selecting a link, the list below displays only those levels from that link where rooms containing fire alarm devices have been found. | For each level, the UI now displays a separate count for rooms with devices and empty rooms in the format Rooms: 7 + 10. It also indicates the total number of devices in rooms and homeless devices (not assigned to any room). | You can select one or more levels for processing by checking the boxes next to them. | . | . 3.1. Layout and Mapping Configuration . At the bottom of the window, there are two fields for fine-tuning the command’s behavior: . | Sensor Definitions (Sensors): . | This field determines which devices will be placed in the top row of the diagram (considered “sensors”). All other devices will be placed in the bottom row. | Each line corresponds to one rule. | Format: FamilyName: TypeName. The type name can be omitted, in which case all types of the specified family will be considered sensors. Matching is case-insensitive. | . | Family Mapping: . | This field defines the rules by which 3D device families and types are transformed into 2D symbols on the diagram. | Format: 3D_Family: 3D_Type: 2D_Family: 2D_Type. | Each line represents a single rule. For example, the line SRS_Smoke_Detector: Standard: Fire alarm 2d: Smoke detector means that all 3D devices with family SRS_Smoke_Detector and type Standard will be represented on the diagram by the 2D symbol Smoke detector from the family Fire alarm 2d. Matching of 3D family and type names is case-insensitive. | Automatic Pre-population: When the dialog opens, the command automatically scans the Revit model and identifies all unique (3D_Family, 3D_Type) combinations of fire alarm devices. | Any newly discovered (3D_Family, 3D_Type) combinations that are not yet in the user’s saved mapping settings are automatically appended to the list. For these new entries, the default values Fire alarm 2d and Generic are used for the 2D family and 2D type, respectively. | Existing user settings, including comments and order, are always preserved. | . | Editing Features: The field includes a built-in header demonstrating the string format and uses a monospaced font for convenience. | Comments: Lines starting with a ; character are ignored during parsing but are preserved and can be used for comments. | Alignment: Text in this field is automatically aligned for better readability. | . | . 3.2. Additional Options . | Create empty rooms: . | If this option is enabled (checked), the command will create 2D representations for all rooms on the selected levels, even if they do not contain any fire alarm devices. | By default, this option is disabled, and 2D rooms are only created for 3D rooms that contain at least one device. | . | . 3.3. Manual Placement and Room Locking . After the initial diagram creation, you may want to manually adjust the layout of devices within certain rooms and lock their positions to prevent them from being reset during subsequent synchronizations. This is achieved using the “Manual placement” instance parameter (a Yes/No type) on the 2D room family. | How it works: . | Select one or more 2D rooms on the diagram. | In the Properties palette, find the “Manual placement” parameter and check the box (set its value to “Yes”). | . | What happens on the next sync: . | Device Positions are Preserved: The command will no longer automatically arrange the existing 2D devices within this room. Their current positions will be locked. | Room Width is Preserved: The width of this 2D room will also be locked and will not automatically change based on the number of devices. | New Devices: If new devices are added to this room in the 3D model, their 2D symbols will appear in the center of the locked room. This allows you to easily find and manually place them where needed. | . | . ",

    "content": ". | What the Command Does | Preparation | Usage | Results | . The command automates the process of creating and updating openings in walls for the passage of MEP elements. It analyzes intersections, considers existing openings, merges closely located new openings, and generates a detailed report on the actions performed. What the Command Does . | Finds intersections between walls and MEP elements (ducts, pipes, cable trays, etc.) in both the current project and linked models. | Manages existing openings: Instead of creating duplicates, the command can expand or merge openings that already exist in the wall. | Automatically merges closely located calculated openings into a single common one to avoid numerous small holes. | Writes the final dimensions of all openings into a specified wall parameter as a numbered list. | Is flexibly configured through a dialog box, allowing the user to control all key parameters. | Creates a detailed report of all actions performed (creation, modification, deletion) and displays it in an interactive window. | . Preparation . Before running the command, ensure that your 3D view is set up to show all the walls and MEP elements you want to process. Usage . When the command is launched, a settings dialog box opens. | Wall Selection: . | Process selected walls only: If this checkbox is marked, the command will only work with the walls you selected before launching. Otherwise, all walls in the project will be processed. | The OK button dynamically displays the number of walls that will be processed. | . | MEP Category Selection: . | Mark the checkboxes for the MEP system categories for which openings need to be created. | . | Opening Parameters: . | Air gap (mm): A buffer added to the dimensions of each MEP element. This increases the final size of the opening. Default: 30 mm. | Merge threshold (mm): The maximum width of a wall section between openings. If the gap between the edges of two adjacent openings is less than this value, they will be merged into one. Default: 100 mm. | Info Parameter: The name of the text parameter in the wall where the final list of all opening sizes will be written. Default: Comments. | . | Filtering and Rounding: . | Min MEP element size (mm): MEP elements whose largest dimension is smaller than the specified value will be ignored. Useful for filtering out small elements. Default: 0. | Rounding step (mm): Rounds the final width and height of the opening to a multiple of the specified number. Default: 10. | Up (checkbox enabled): Rounds up to the nearest greater multiple (e.g., 405 -&gt; 410). | Nearest (checkbox disabled): Mathematical rounding (e.g., 405 -&gt; 400). | . | Visualize Bounding Box for debugging: Creates geometry in the model showing the bounding boxes of MEP elements. Warning: This geometry is not automatically deleted. Use this option for debugging only and delete the created elements manually to avoid cluttering the project. | . | Ignore by Parameter: . | Allows setting rules to filter MEP elements. Elements that satisfy at least one rule will be ignored. Parameter names are case-sensitive, while values are not. | Format: Each rule on a new line: ParameterName: Value. | Wildcard: You can use the * symbol to match any sequence of characters. | Pseudo-parameters: Family (family name) and Type (type name) are supported. | Comments: Lines starting with ; are ignored. | Example: ; Ignore all elements on worksets containing \"placeholder\" Workset: *placeholder* ; Ignore elements with a specific comment Comment: *ignore* . | . | . Results . After performing the calculations, the command displays an interactive report with the results, creates/modifies/deletes openings in the Revit model, and writes the final information to the walls. Writing to Wall Parameter: A numbered list of the final sizes (WxH) of all openings in a given wall is written to the text parameter specified in the settings. Example: . 1. 630x480 2. 280x330 3. 70x70 . If there are no openings in the wall after processing, the parameter is cleared. When processing only selected walls, the parameters of unprocessed walls are not changed. This parameter is useful for creating view filters to display only those walls that have openings (by setting up a filter rule for “parameter is not empty”). Report Format: The report contains lines for each action in the format: Action | Wall ID | Opening ID | Description . The Description column has a 5-part structure: Old ID | New Size (WxH) | Old Size (WxH) | Source (MEP ID) | Merge Info . | CREATED: A new opening was created. | Example: CREATED | w777 | op888 | 500x300 | MEP_IDs: main:1,2 | . | MODIFIED: An existing opening was modified. | Example: MODIFIED | w778 | op999 | 123 | 600x400 | 500x300 | MEP_IDs: link:3 | Merged with: 456 | . | DELETED: An existing opening was deleted because it was merged with another. | Example: DELETED | w779 | op456 | | | Merged into: 999 | . | .

    "content": ". | Working with Views and Cropping: The tool processes not just linked DWG files from the link manager, but their specific instances placed on views (primarily floor plans). This is a key mechanism for correctly correlating coordinates when a single DWG file contains multiple floor plans offset from each other. | Your Action: Before running the tool, you must manually place and align each instance of the linked DWG on the corresponding plan view in Revit. | Tool’s Action: The tool reads the transformation (offset and rotation) of each instance and correctly calculates the block positions in the shared Revit coordinate system. | Filtering: Additionally, you will have to use the Crop Box on the view to limit processing to only the desired part of the DWG. Blocks outside the crop box will be ignored for that level. | Verification: You can check if your setup is correct on the Blocks sheet in the Excel file. For each block, it shows the number of its occurrences on each view (in “View: \" columns). If the count does not match your expectations, check the alignment and crop boundaries of the DWG link. | . | “Corner” Mode: If you specify “Corner” in the OffsetX or OffsetY columns, the offset will be automatically calculated as half the family’s width/length. This is useful for elements that are inserted by their corner, not their center. | Unit Recognition: When transferring numeric parameters, the tool automatically recognizes and converts values with suffixes such as kW, MW, W, V, kV, kg. | Backups: Before modifying your Excel mapping file, the tool automatically creates a full copy of it with a timestamp. The files are saved in the folder: %AppData%\\Sener\\BimTools\\Reports\\CadToRevit\\Backups\\. | Comments in DWG Paths: In the tool’s window, you can paste a list of paths to DWG files. Lines starting with a ; symbol will be ignored, allowing you to temporarily disable files from processing. | Caution with Manual Copying: When you copy a family instance created by this tool, you also copy its “DWG info” service parameter. This creates a duplicate link, and during the next sync, the tool will silently update only the original instance, ignoring all copies. | Recommendation: Do not copy elements managed by this tool. If you need a “dumb” copy, be sure to clear the value of its “DWG info” parameter to break the link. | Note: In the future, this behavior is planned to be improved so that the tool itself updates the link (based on location) and reports such collisions. | . | .
